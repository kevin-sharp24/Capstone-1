## Capstone 1: Identify Risk Factors of Type 2 Diabetes
### Background
Diabetes, particularly type 2 diabetes, is a leading contributor to mortality rate in the United States and has known associations with heart disease, kidney disease, and other health problems. According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA), diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death among Americans in 2017. Additionally, the ADA reported $327 billion in medical costs and $90 billion in reduced productivity associated with diabetes for that same year.

Since type 2 diabetes is a preventable disease, identifying its risk factors would allow for earlier detection, prevention, and treatment of at-risk patients by health professionals. This in turn would improve the health of the general United States population and help to reduce the financial burden that treatment places on the economy.
